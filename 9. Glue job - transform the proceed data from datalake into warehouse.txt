Create a redshift cluster with dev database.
In dev database create a ecommerce schema.
In ecommerce schema create a customer table similar to "vinod-lakeformation-processed-database"."processed_customer" but with customer_id as int instead of long.

create schema ecommerce;

CREATE TABLE ecommerce.customers(
  customer_id int, 
  prefix varchar(10), 
  first_name varchar(100), 
  last_name varchar(100), 
  gender varchar(5));

In Glue Studio, create a Redshift connector.
Create a Glue job with source as Glue Data Catalog table "vinod-lakeformation-processed-database"."processed_customer" and target as redshift ecommerce table "customers".
Use the connector created above for the glue job to be able to identify the redshift url/credentials.

Run the glue job and validate the data in Redshift.

==============

Also, you can query S3 datalake directly from Redhsift instead of copying teh data into Redshift.
Go to the Query Editor in Redshift Serverless.
From the top, left, Create Schema (note that you need to have a cluster/workgroup in order to be able to use this feature) -> External -> Glue Data Catalog -> vinod-lakeformation-processed-database = Give a name for this extrnal schema, say "datalake".

Now, you can query S3 using:
select * from datalake.processed_customer;
