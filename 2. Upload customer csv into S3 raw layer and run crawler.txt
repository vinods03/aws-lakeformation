1. Upload customer.csv at s3://vinod-lakeformation-raw-bucket/input/customer

2. From Lake Formation, create Crawler - vinod-lakeformation-raw-customer-crawler - on above path. Provide the database as vinod-lakeformation-raw-database and table prefix as sales_.

3. I used the MyGlueRoleWithAdminAccess role for the crawler.

4. Upon running the Glue crawler and after it completed, verify that the sales_customer table is created in vinod-lakeformation-raw-database

5. Open Athena and try to run a query on this table. It failed for me. 
   Then in Athena - Settings - I gave the Query result location as s3://vinod-lakeformation-raw-bucket/athena/ and then tried again. It worked.
